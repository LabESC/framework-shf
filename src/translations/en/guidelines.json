The initial approach to evaluating the social and human factors influencing requirements management in software ecosystems is to understand the day-to-day factors encountered by professionals involved in requirements management activities and to uncover the contextual characteristics of requirements management. Consequently, inquire with team professionals about the factors they have encountered, present a list of barriers hindering the improvement of social and human factors, and ascertain if they have encountered any of these barriers in their requirements management activities in software ecosystems. Inquire about the improvement strategies and coping mechanisms professionals believe could be utilized to overcome these barriers and enhance social and human factors. The tool enables the collection of feedback through a structured questionnaire in the form of organizational research and can also be used to gather feedback through unstructured methods (e.g., retrospectives and individual meetings). This step must be conducted individually. ",
